## üìã Overview

This n8n workflow creates a comprehensive customer support automation system that intelligently processes customer inquiries, routes them to specialized handlers, and provides accurate responses by integrating with live databases and business systems. The workflow maintains conversational context and can handle complex multi-turn interactions seamlessly.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Intelligent Intent Recognition**: Automatically classifies customer queries (order tracking, support tickets, product recommendations, etc.)
- **Specialized Agent Routing**: Routes queries to purpose-built sub-agents based on detected intent
- **Real-time Database Integration**: Connects to live systems (Supabase, PostgreSQL) for order lookups and data retrieval
- **Session Memory Management**: Maintains conversation context for natural, multi-turn interactions
- **Automated Ticket Generation**: Creates and tracks support tickets with unique IDs
- **Multi-channel Support**: Handles messages from email (Gmail), chat, and web interfaces
- **Dynamic Response Construction**: AI-powered responses that can request additional information when needed

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Workflow Components

1. **Message Reception**
   - Gmail Trigger monitors incoming customer emails
   - Captures and processes customer messages from multiple channels
   - Initiates the support workflow automatically

4. **Backend Data Access**
   - OpenRouter Chat Model for natural language understanding
   - Pinecone Vector Store for knowledge retrieval
   - Embeddings OpenAI for semantic search capabilities
   - Integration points for Supabase/PostgreSQL databases

5. **Response Management**
   - Gmail nodes for email replies
   - Add labels to organize conversations
   - Context-aware response generation
   - Automated follow-up and confirmation handling

6. **Session Memory**
